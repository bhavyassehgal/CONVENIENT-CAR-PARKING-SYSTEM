# CONVENIENT CAR PARKING SYSTEM
*A combined effort by me and my team*

### INTRODUCTION

Car Parking is the demonstration of halting and withdrawing a vehicle and leaving it abandoned. Stopping on one or the two sides of a street is regularly allowed, however now and again with limitations. Nations and neighborhood governments have rules for plan and utilization of parking spots. 


### CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PARKING SYSTEMS

•	The most concerning issue in parking spots is that we don't know where we are getting our vehicle into, and that will we discover space or not. 

•	Paid Parking regions: Individuals pay for leaving their vehicle in parts where there is no security of their vehicles, and nobody can be considered responsible. 

•	Non-effective, old school techniques to gather installment from individuals and give them receipts, no cutting-edge way to deal with this issue.


### ABOUT OUR SYSTEM

•	We have presented the judicious frameworks which will empower clients to review the current status of a parking spot, with the goal that clients can find out about where to leave their vehicles. 

•	We have additionally planned the quantity of vehicles entering the parking utilizing computerized reasoning (Artificial Intelligence) and furthermore utilizing python, to take care of the information into out framework, this way we will came to know the quantity of vehicles entering and leaving and number of vehicles right now left in the parking. 

•	Alongside this, the client would have full security, as he would get a message when his/her vehicle enters the carport and when it leaves.


### THE PURPOSE

We are designing this car parking system just to minimize the hassle of cars and to limit the issue vehicle owners need to look consistently.

The purpose of this task is to limit the issue that every vehicle owner needs to confront while discovering a parking spot for vehicle, this framework would be effective so it would assist with lessening pollution just as give true calmness to a vehicle owner, with all the security highlights we will add, the client will consistently be educated about the current status of his/her vehicle. 

With this cutting edge and modern policy, we will grow this framework cross country, and afterward universally. 


### CONCEPT USED

•	Utilizing Python as our principal coding language, and utilizing amazing and productive libraries, we have made a program, that will dispose of this problem.

•	Utilizing this program, and coordinating them with the flow electric cost doors, we can distinguish and deal with the quantity of vehicles entering and leaving the parking spot. 

•	Our Program is progressed to such an extent that we need zero human effort, everything is finished by the actual code, it consequently perceives the vehicle number, takes input and makes a passage. 

•	With our code, we add an extra-layer of safety, which will help vehicle proprietors consistently be educated about their vehicle status, at whatever point they wish to.


### EXPANDABILITY

•	In the beginning, this system would be only used in parking lots of Malls and managed parking spaces in metro cities.

•	Cars would then be main focus for this system, and we would expand to bus, trucks and 2-wheelers in future.

•	Addition of a monitor to show the live status of the parking lot, which updates in real time.

•	Payments are linked to a fasting system, which will deduct amount as per the time for which the car was parked in the garage.
